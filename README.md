# Text Flipper Deluxe

### Text Flipper Deluxe is a fun app I put together for some DOM practice one rainy August evening.

The app that takes a user's input into a text box, validates it against a regex, then outputs a flipped version of the inputted string based on key-values in a Javascript object.  The regex is currently set to accept letters and spaces only, as that was all I defined in the key-values.

A "clear" button lets the user clear the screen in between submissions.
